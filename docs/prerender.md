# Prerendering for SEO

If you want to prerender routes that will not significantly change once pushed to production, use this Webpack plugin: [prerender-spa-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prerender-spa-plugin), which has been tested for use with Vue. For pages that _do_ frequently change, [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing) both offer plans for regularly re-prerendering your content for search engines.
